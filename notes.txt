To level up, you can introduce Apollo Server (for production-ready GraphQL features) 
and TypeGraphQL (which makes it easier to build schemas using TypeScript classes).

1. Apollo Server:

Replace express-graphql with apollo-server-express for more options with caching, subscriptions, etc.

2. TypeGraphQL:

TypeGraphQL leverages decorators and Typescriptâ€™s type system for a cleaner setup.
